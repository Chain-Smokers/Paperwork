### Private Blockchain
Private blockchain made using geth:
 - Ethereum network is private if none of the nodes are connected to the mainnet
 - Private means reserved/isolated and not protected/secure


### Requirements
1. Linux operating system: Using Ubuntu 22.04 (Kernel: Kernel: 5.15.0-56-generic)
2. Bash shell
3. Ethereum toolchain: geth


### Ethereum
P2P network where data is stored directly between nodes rather than a central server.

### geth
Ethereum client written in Go.
Running geth turns computer into ethereum node.
#### prerequisites
 - Knowledge of command line
 - Knowledge of Ethereum
 - Knowledge of HTTP
 - Knowledge of JavaScript


### Note
 - In Solidity smart contracts, deployment requires transaction and gas fee, storing requires transaction and gas fee; but retrieving data doesn't require transaction nor gas fee.


## Consensus algorithms
Blockchain being decentralized, it provides privacy, security, transparency and immutability.i Irrespective of there being no central authority to verify transactions on blockchain network, every transaction is considered to be verified and valid. Consensus is responsible for this feature of blockchain. It is one of the core part in blockchain network. Consensus algorithm is process in which peers in the blockchain network reach common agreement about the current ledger state. Doing so, consensus algorithm takes care of validity of transaction that is to be added to the ledger.

### 1. Proof of Work (PoW)
### 2. Proof of Stake (PoS)
### 3. Proof of Authority (PoA)
