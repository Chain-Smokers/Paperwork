<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A widespread mistrust towards the traditional voting system has made democratic voting in any country very critical. People have seen their fundamental rights being violated. Other digital voting systems have been challenged due to a lack of transparency. Most voting systems are not transparent enough; this makes it very difficult for the government to gain votersâ€™ trust. The reason behind the failure of the traditional and current digital voting system is that it can be easily exploited. The primary objective is to resolve problems of the traditional and digital voting system, which include any kind of mishap or injustice during the process of voting. Blockchain technology can be used in the voting system to have a fair election and reduce injustice. The physical voting systems have many flaws in it as well as the digital voting systems are not perfect enough to be implemented on large scale. This appraises the need for a solution to secure the democratic rights of the people. This article presents a platform based on modern technology blockchain that provides maximum transparency and reliability of the system to build a trustful relationship between voters and election authorities. The proposed platform provides a framework that can be implemented to conduct voting activity digitally through blockchain without involving any physical polling stations. Our proposed framework supports a scalable blockchain, by using flexible consensus algorithms. The Chain Security Algorithm applied in the voting system makes the voting transaction more secure. Smart contracts provide a secure connection between the user and the network while executing a transaction in the chain. The security of the blockchain based voting system has also been discussed. Additionally, encryption of transactions using cryptographic hash and prevention of attack 51% on the blockchain has also been elaborated. Furthermore, the methodology for carrying out blockchain transactions during the process of voting has been elaborated using Blockchain Finally, the performance evaluation of the proposed system shows that the system can be implemented in a large-scale population.</p>
